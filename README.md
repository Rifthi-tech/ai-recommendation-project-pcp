## 📋 Overview

A complete machine learning pipeline for product recommendations that:
- Processes product data (titles, descriptions, categories, ratings, prices)
- Trains KNN model with combined feature engineering
- Evaluates recommendation quality with multiple metrics
- Exports trained model for production use
- Includes ready-to-deploy web application

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Google Colab
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/product-recommendation-system/blob/main/Product_Recommendation_System.ipynb)

1. Upload your product dataset
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Get trained model and recommendations
4. Download model files automatically

📊 Features
Core ML Pipeline
  - ✅ Data Preprocessing - Text cleaning, missing value handling
  - ✅ Feature Engineering - TF-IDF vectors + numerical features
  - ✅ Model Training - KNN with cosine similarity
  - ✅ Evaluation - Similarity scores, category accuracy
  - ✅ Export - Model persistence with Pickle

Output Files
- product_recommendation_model.pkl - Trained model + vectorizer
- product_recommendations.csv - All recommendation pairs
- model_summary.txt - Performance report

🏗️ Architecture

Raw Data → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → KNN Training → Model Evaluation
                                                                     
   CSV File   →   Cleaning & Encoding  → TF-IDF + Numerical Scaling → Cosine Similarity Calculation  → Metrics Calculation   
            
   
📈 Model Performance
Metric	Score	Description

- Avg Similarity	0.85+	How similar recommendations are to source
- Category Match	80%+	Recommendations in same category
- Price Similarity	70%+	Recommendations in similar price range

# Get recommendations for a product
product_id = 8376765  # Backpack
recommendations = get_recommendations(product_id, n=5)

- Output similar products with:
 - Titles, categories, ratings
- Similarity scores (0-1)
 - Prices and product IDs
 - 
Features:
- Search by Product ID or Name
- Real-time recommendations
- Similarity scores visualization
- Product details display

🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Scikit-learn - KNN, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity
- Pandas & NumPy - Data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn - Visualization
- Pickle - Model serialization

📚 Dataset Requirements
The system expects a CSV file with columns:
- product_id - Unique identifier
- title - Product name
- product_description - Product description
- rating - Product rating (0-5)
- initial_price - Product price
- category - Product category
- product_details - Additional details (optional)
- product_specifications - Technical specs (optional)

🎓 How It Works
- Text Processing: Convert titles/descriptions to TF-IDF vectors
- Feature Combination: Merge with normalized ratings/prices
- Similarity Calculation: Use cosine similarity in KNN
- Recommendation Generation: Find nearest neighbors
- Quality Evaluation: Calculate accuracy metrics
